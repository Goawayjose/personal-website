      <h1><strong>I am a passionate artist who paints the internet.</strong></h1>
    
      <div id="mephoto"></div>
      
    <p id="Pabo">This love for art was developed in High School while in a visual arts academy and I was happy to be able to experiment with various tools of expression. During this time is when I first received my first exposure to computer design through CSS and HTML.</p>
      
      <h1 align="right">Computer design is the most relevant and growing form of art in the world.</h1><h3 align="right"><i>Web pages are under going a revolution where even the most corporate website has an artistic style.</i></h3>
      <p>My objective is to develop aesthetically great, functioning online sites. I focus on the aesthitic design of the page as well as the users-interaction with the page. I try to maintain a high level of creativity while making the page managable to new users. I take this approach with all my projects running multiple tests and constantly updating work. It is also of the upmost importance to make the sites cross compatible across deferent platforms. For some projects there maybe multiple designs just to accommodate to certain devices.  </p>
      <p>
          
<h2>In order to have the best web pages one needs to use the best technologies for the job.</h2>
        </br> 
        
        <p>
My high school experience with coding also taught me that you can&rsquo;t rely on school solely to stay up to date with the current technologies. Most curriculums will teach the basics of computing very well but won&rsquo;t teach the new tools that are necessary in today&rsquo;s online world. This is the reason I&rsquo;ve made learning about new languages a part of my lifestyle. I entertain myself with learning about computer languages online it has become an essential part of my life. I find it exciting to see the different possibilities in design. I have made this pursuit of computer knowledge and expression a part of my lifestyle.<br><br>
 This industry is always changing and I wish to adapt with it as it grows; in order to produce the most technologically advanced and naturally flowing web experience possible. I want to put my skills to good use designing all sorts of sites from fun creative sites to more straightforward corporate style sites. It&rsquo;s my mission in life to create memorable online experiences and look forward to working with anyone who can help me achieve this goal.
